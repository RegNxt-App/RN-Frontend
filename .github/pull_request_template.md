## Developer Instructions

- Whenever you create a PR, make sure you only assign a reviewer to the PR when you are done working on it and is ready for the review. **Do not** assign a reviewer when you are just working on it (this must be followed strictly since a few automations depend on this instruction).
- Your PR will be judged (approved/dimissed) on [rubric given below](#pr-approval-checklist). As a developer, it is considered good manners to analyze your own PRs on the rubric before asking for a review.

## Reviewer Instructions

- Keep a close eye on the console or rather, always keep it open.
- Check on different screen sizes if it is a responsive screen (functional reviewer only).
- Review in normal browser window and in incogito mode (functional reviewer only).
- **DO NOT** forget to check the items in the following checklist.
- Some items may not be applicable for some tasks so check the N/A column for that item.
- Make sure to **track your time** on the task as reviewer.
- Make sure to add a tag (either 'dev_review' or 'func_review' or both) to your tracked time entries.
- All the items in the rubric below must be checked off in order for the PR to be considered approved. Even if a single check is failing, PR will be considered unapproved and will be sent back to (changes requested stage) the developer to fix.
