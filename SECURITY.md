## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of RegNxt seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly.
2. Send a detailed report to our security team:
   - Email: [security@regnxt.com](mailto:security@regnxt.com)
   - Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours.
- **Updates**: You'll receive updates on the progress of your report every 3-5 business days.
- **Resolution Timeline**: We strive to resolve critical issues within 7 days of disclosure.

### Security Review Process

1. Our security team will evaluate the report
2. We'll determine severity and priority
3. We'll develop and test a fix
4. We'll coordinate with you regarding disclosure

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate the efforts of security researchers who help keep RegNxt secure.

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted under this policy to constitute "authorized" conduct and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and interruption of our services
- Only interact with accounts they own or have explicit permission to access
- Do not exploit a security issue for purposes other than verification
- Report any vulnerability within reasonable time
- Keep vulnerability details private until we resolve them
